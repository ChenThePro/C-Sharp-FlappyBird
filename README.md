C# Project - FlappyBird game

This project, "FlappyBird" is a project I have been working on in order to learn how to develope games through game engines as unity, unreal engine and more.

The purpose of the project is to have fun. I had a blast time making it and experimenting with C# and unity. So I hope you would like it :)

I learnt and used a few tools to make this project. making cripts, adjusting settings, learning about the scene, game objects and more!!!.

shout-out to Britishgaming for the tutorial.
